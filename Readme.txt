This purpose of this project is to learn python programming. I want to apply my knowledge of python to learn other coding languages, create scripts to automate tasks, and build applications. The projects completed were derived from taking Udemy's 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021. I found this course to be easy to follow, and the material is well presented by Dr. Angela Yu.
